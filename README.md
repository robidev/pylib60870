# pylib60870
This is a python wrapped server and client example of the lib60870 library. it is based on the excellent IEC 60870 library; 
https://github.com/mz-automation/lib60870. 

A slightly modified version is included as binary, but its best to recompile the original library yourself. this can be done by downloading the library from https://github.com/mz-automation/lib60870, and issuing 
`make dynlib`

based on that library the python wrapper can be auto-generated by ctypesgen. the command I used can be seen on the top of the file lib60870.py

After ensuring lib6870*.so and lib60870.py are present, the server/client example can be run by issuing 

`python lib104_server_class.py`
`python lib104_client_class.py`

Note: this is a python3 example.
