# pylib60870
This is a python wrapped server and client example of the lib60870 library. it is based on the excellent IEC 60870 library; 
https://github.com/mz-automation/lib60870. 

A version is included as binary, but its best to recompile the original library yourself. this can be done by downloading the library from https://github.com/mz-automation/lib60870, and issuing 
`make dynlib`
to prevent the name clash described with known issues; perform a `mv lib60870.so lib60870_mod.so`

based on that library the python wrapper can be auto-generated by ctypesgen. the command I used can be seen on the top of the file lib60870.py

After ensuring lib6870*.so and lib60870.py are present, the server/client example can be run by issuing 

`python lib104_server_class.py`
`python lib104_client_class.py`

Note: this is a python3 example.

Known issues:
Please be aware that if you receive an error regarding PyInit "ImportError: dynamic module does not define module export function". This is due to the name of the python wrapper being the same as the module. It is resolved by ensuring the python module generated by ctypes is called differently then lib60870.so, or to rename the .so module, like I have done in the included version.
